After completing the EduX berkely online course about AI I thought
it might be a good idea to implement some of the basic ideas in the first homework
using haskell.

I am pretty sure that this piece of code will cause hesart attacks from everyday haskellers
but it was for me a good oportunity to visit some of the haskell concepts. That said I absolutely
love haskell!
